Title: An serialization style flattening and description for JSON.
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Bo",
           family = "Wei",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "ckris@163.com",

Description: mojson supports json flattening in a long data frame way, where the nesting keys will be stored in the absolute 'path'. It also
   provides an easy way to summarize the basic description of a JSON list. The idea of mojson is to transform a JSON object in an 
   absolute serialization way, which means the early key-value pairs will appear in the heading rows of the data frame. 
   mojson also provides an alternative way of comparing two different JSON lists, returning the left/inner/right-join style results.
