Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Bo",
           family = "Wei",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: mojson supports json flattening in a long data frame way, where the nesting keys will be stored as the absolute 'path'. It also
   provides an easy way to summarize the basic description of a JSON object. The idea of mojson is to transform a JSON object in a 
   absolute serialization way
